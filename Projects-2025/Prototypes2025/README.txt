Note on Assembly and Large School Protoype

When calculating savings for measures added to the Assembly and Large School, the baseline should be the Proposed Design results, not the Standard Design's results.

 - The Assembly prototype is ACM-compliant for each of the buildings, but as a whole CIBD model, CBECC will select a VAV system which is not what these individual buildings would have if they were modeled in CBECC separately.

 - The Large School is a prescriptively-compliant building. CBECC will create heat pump systems in the Standard Design, but the baseline should be the central gas system as appears in the Proposed Design.
