Test models contained in this folder are utilized for testing a new glazing simulation method, developed exclusively for simulation of glazing objects with U-factors above the EnergyPlus effective limit of approximately 1.03 Btu/hr-ft2-F.  Vertical fenestration (windows) has been tested using the Office Small Prototype (0200) and horizontal fenestration (skylights) have been tested using the Retail Medium Prototype (0500). 

An alternative simulation methodology was developed cases where the user input U-factor is greater than the E+ simulation limitations (Effective Maximum of 1.03 Btu/hr-ft2-F). In the ‘Inside Air-film Convection Coefficient’ method the U-factor is restricted to the E+ effective maximum limit and the overall effective U-factor is adjusted by specifying a fixed corrected interior air-film covection coefficient.

The models in the test suite are labeled using the format:

Please note that all models simulated using the ‘Fixed Inside Film’ method but with fenestration U-factor below the E+ effective maximum limit (1.03 Btu/hr-ft2-F) have the property ‘UseInsideConvCoef’ set to ‘1’. ‘UseInsideConvCoef’ has been defined and used exclusively for testing purposes and will be removed from the release versions.  Loading these models without the property 'UseInsideConvCoef' enabled will result in errors.
