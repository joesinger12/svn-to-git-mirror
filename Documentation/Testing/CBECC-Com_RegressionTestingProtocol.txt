Before merging development branches to the CBECC-Com trunk, the following steps should be followed to a) minimize risk of related or unrelated bugs and b) document the impact of changes on compliance margins and other important simulation metrics.

Step 1) Locally merge branch(s) of RulesetDev and CBECC-Com to the trunk folder. Resolve all tree and file conflicts, and perform a test SVN commit to see list of changed ruleset source and/or program files, and confirm the changes your expect are listed.

Step 2) If changes have been made to project test files, locally merge the branch project file updates to the trunk as well.

Step 3) Create a batch test input file, re-compile rules, and run batch test. 

Step 4) Create a new test results folder under \trunk\Projects-XXXX\Testing\rXXXX, and copy the SDD Sim XML files from batch test output folder to this folder, along with batch results summary csv file. 

Step 5) Confirm tests results are as expected by:

    a) Comparing the batch summary results to the pervious set of results using the Excel template. For models that have changed, draft an explanation of why they changed.

    b) Diffing the new SDD Sim XML file folders with the file folders from previous tests using a text differencing tool.

Step 6) Once batch testing is complete and results align with expectations, commit the following information to the Testing\rXXXX folder. 
  - Batch test result csv output file
  - Sim XML files for all models. To save repository space, compress the into a 7-Zip (.7z) archive using 'Maximum' compression.  If there are no changes to the energy/TDV results, it is acceptable to NOT commit the Sim XML files unless you see differences in the XML files that are noteworthy and feel an explanation of what should have changed in commit comments is not sufficient.
