---- Google Sketch-up Logging ----

The logging is typically disabled in the plug-in for speed reasons.  However, you can go into your install at:
 
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenStudio X.X.X\Ruby\openstudio\sketchup_plugin\lib\PluginManager.rb

And modify the values for following lines as shown:

$OPENSTUDIO_SKETCHUPPLUGIN_DEVELOPER_MENU = true # default is false, enable to see developer menu
$OPENSTUDIO_SKETCHUPPLUGIN_CURRENT_METHOD_NAME = true # default is false, disable to speed up
$OPENSTUDIO_SKETCHUPPLUGIN_LOGGING = true # default is false, disable to speed up

After these changes are made you will get another menu under “Plugins -> OpenStudio Developer” , 
there is a menu item you can click to “Enable Logging”. 

To find the folder where the log file is located, you can open the ruby console in SketchUp and type:

OpenStudio::Plugin.log_dir

Here is where it is on one example Windows system:

C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Temp\OpenStudio\SketchUpPlugin
